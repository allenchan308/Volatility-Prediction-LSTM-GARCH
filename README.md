# LSTM-GARCH Volatility Forecasting on Log-Return of S&P 500
This repository contains the code and analysis for an independent capstone project investigating the effectiveness of combining a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network with a Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model to forecast the realized volatility of the S&P 500 index (^GSPC).
